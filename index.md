# Snakemake bring-your-own-code (BYOC) workshop

Workshop open for PhD students (prioritized), postdocs, researchers and others
who have previously participated in the [NBIS Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This workshop is organized by [NBIS](https://nbis.se/).

Teachers:
* Verena Kutschera
* Erik Fasterius
* John Sundh
* Per Unneberg

Contact information: edu.byoc-snakemake@nbis.se

**Date and location**

The workshop is held online on 5-7 October 2020.

## Workshop description

As data analysis projects grow and change over time it gets increasingly
difficult to keep track of how the different parts of the data analysis fit
together. Workflow management systems such as Snakemake can be used to set up,
perform and monitor defined sequences of computational tasks ("workflows"),
thereby making data analyses reproducible and scalable. Snakemake was developed
in the bioinformatics community and has some features that make it particularly
well-suited for bioinformatic workflows.

The [NBIS Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
is held twice a year and provides both an introduction to Snakemake and
a tutorial on how to use it.

This Snakemake BYOC (bring-your-own-code) workshop provides a follow-up to that
introduction. Here, participants will get support from experienced
bioinformaticians to A) convert their data analysis from a programming language
such as bash, R or Python into a Snakemake workflow, or B) apply more advanced
techniques to their existing Snakemake workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Previous participation in the [NBIS Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Your own bioinformatics analysis scripts in any programming language that you
  would like to convert into Snakemake *OR* your own Snakemake workflow that you
  would like to improve
- A computer with a webcam running Linux or Mac OS (if you run Windows and are
  interested in participating please contact the workshop organizers by email, see
  above, before applying). You will be asked to install the video conferencing
  software [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) to be able to participate in the workshop
  (see the [pre-workshop information](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-snakemake-byoc/precourse)).
