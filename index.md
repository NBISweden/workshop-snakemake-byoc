# Snakemake bring-your-own-code (BYOC) workshop

**This website is currently under construction and subject to change.**

Workshop open for PhD students (prioritized), postdocs, researchers and others who have previously participated in the [NBIS Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This workshop is organized by [NBIS](https://nbis.se/).

Instructors:
* Verena Kutschera
* Erik Fasterius
* John Sundh
* Per Unneberg

Contact information: edu.byoc-snakemake@nbis.se


**Date and location**

The workshop is held online on 5-7 October 2020.


## Course description

As data analysis projects grow and change over time, it gets increasingly difficult to keep track of how the different parts of the data analysis fit together. Workflow management systems such as snakemake can be used to set up, perform and monitor defined sequences of computational tasks (“workflows”), thereby making data analyses reproducible and scalable. Snakemake was developed in the bioinformatics community and has some features that make it particularly well suited for bioinformatics workflows.

The [NBIS Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is held twice a year and provides an introduction into snakemake and a tutorial to learn how to use snakemake. 

This snakemake BYOC (bring-your-own-code) workshop provides a follow up to that introduction. Here, participants will get support from experienced bioinformaticians to A) convert their data analysis from a programming language such as bash, R or python into a snakemake workflow, or B) apply more advanced techniques to their existing snakemake workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Previous participation in the [NBIS Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Your own bioinformatics analysis scripts in any programming language that you would like to convert into snakemake OR your own snakemake workflow that you would like to improve
- A computer with a webcam running Linux or Mac OS (if you run Windows and are interested in participating, please contact the course leaders by email, see above, before applying). You will be asked to install the video conferencing software [zoom](https://zoom.us/) to be able to participate in the workshop (see [Pre-course information](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-snakemake-byoc/precourse)).
