# The GenErode pipeline

* Developed in a NBIS project with Love Dal√©n's lab (Centre for Palaeogenetics, SU & NRM)

--

* Compares population genomics statistics from historical and modern samples of endangered populations

.center[<img src="sumatran_rhino_3_2016-07-13.jpg" width=40%/>]
.center[.tiny[Sumatran rhinoceros (_Dicerorhinus sumatrensis_), critically endangered]]
--

* Data processing from fastq files to BAM & VCF files plus downstream population genomics analyses

---

# The GenErode pipeline

* Started at Snakemake version 3.10 (!), current pipeline runs with Snakemake version 5.22

--

* Historical and modern samples are processed in parallel

--

* Whole-genome resequencing data from historical/ancient samples needs special processing as DNA degrades over time

--

* Some analyses or filtering steps are run separately for modern and historical samples, or only for historical samples

---

--


* `Snakefile`
    * Python code to create sample and readgroup ID dictionaries & lists from metadata tables and a config file
    * `include` of rule Snakefiles
    * `all` rule collecting output files produced by the different rule Snakefiles


--

* UPPMAX / slurm system: 
    * `cluster.yaml` file to set up slurm profile

---

# The Workflow Structure

* Metadata files for historical and modern samples (separately)
    * Sample IDs, readgroup IDs, sequencing technology, paths to fastq files

--

* Example `historical_samples.txt` file (whitespace-separated)

```{r Metadata structure, echo = FALSE}
# Function for creating tables
create_table <- function(data, full_width = TRUE) {
    data %>%
        kable() %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("basic", "hover"),
                      font_size         = 10,
                      fixed_thead       = TRUE,
                      full_width        = full_width,
                      position          = "center")
}

# Define and show metadata
metadata <- data.frame(samplename_index_lane    = c("VK01_01_L2","VK01_02_L2"),
                       readgroup_id             = c("BHYOX3ALTH.L2.01","BHYOX3ALTH.L2.02"),
                       readgroup_platform       = c(rep("illumina",2)),
                       path_to_R1_fastq         = c("data/S1/P01_2.R1.fq.gz","data/S1/P02_2.R1.fq.gz"),
                       path_to_R2_fastq         = c("data/S1/P01_2.R2.fq.gz","data/S1/P02_2.R2.fq.gz"))
create_table(metadata)
```

# The Workflow Structure

* Config file `config.yaml` (to be edited by users, placed in `config/`)
    * Paths to input data and metadata tables
    * Selection of analysis steps to be run
    * Parameters for different rules
    * Lists with samples for optional analyses

--

```{python config file data, eval = FALSE}
#################################################################
# 1) Full path to reference genome assembly.
# Reference genome has to be checked for short and concise fasta 
# headers without special characters. 
# File name extension can be ".fasta" or ".fa".

# How to choose which steps to run

**Step 1**: Use booleans in the config file (`config/config.yaml`) as on/off switches

--

```{python config file start, eval = FALSE}
#####
# FastQC on raw reads, adapter trimming, read merging (historical samples), FastQC on trimmed reads.
fastq_processing: True

[...]
#####

#####
# Map historical and modern reads to reference genome assembly (specified above).
mapping: False
#####
```

---

# How to choose which steps to run

**Step 1**: Use booleans in the config file (`config/config.yaml`) as on/off switches

* For many analysis steps, parameters can be specified in the config file:

--

```{python config file parameters, eval = FALSE}
#####
# FastQC on raw reads, adapter trimming, read merging (historical samples), FastQC on trimmed reads.
fastq_processing: True

# Adapter sequences for trimming of historical samples using SeqPrep v1.1 (modified source code) 
# Forward read primer/adapter sequence to trim historical samples in SeqPrep v1.1 (parameter "-A")
hist_F_adapter: "AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACNNNNNNNATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG" # example from Meyer & Kircher 2010
# Reverse read primer/adapter sequence to trim historical samples in SeqPrep v1.1 (parameter "-B")
# When using double indices, include full adapter length (replacing the index by "N")
hist_R_adapter: "AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATTT" # example from Meyer & Kircher 2010

[...]

# Minimum read length allowed after trimming.
# Historical samples (SeqPrep v1.1 with modified source code)
hist_readlength: "30" # default setting: 30 bp

# Modern samples (trim-galore)
mod_readlength: "30"
#####
```

--

* These parameters can be used in the workflow with the syntax `config["parameter_name"]`

---

# How to choose which steps to run

**Step 2**: Use some Python code, `include` and the rule `all` to figure out what the workflow will do

--

* The main `Snakefile` contains an empty Python list `all_outputs` to collect output files from the included rule Snakefiles,

```{python Snakefile outputs list, eval = FALSE}
all_outputs = []
```

--

* the `include` variable to attach the rule Snakefiles corresponding to the analysis steps that were set to `True` in the config file, 


```{python Snakefile include, eval = FALSE}
if config["fastq_processing"]:
    include: "workflow/rules/1.1_fastq_processing.smk"
```

--

* and the rule `all` that takes the output files from the list `all_outputs` as input

```{python Snakefile all, eval = FALSE}
rule all:
    input: all_outputs
```

---

# How to choose which steps to run

**Step 2**: Use some Python code, `include` and the rule `all` to figure out what the workflow will do

* The rule Snakefile (`workflow/rules/1.1_fastq_processing.smk`) contains some Python code to add its 
  final output files to the list `all_outputs` in the main `Snakefile`

--

```{python rules file fastq, eval = FALSE}
import os
if os.path.exists(config["historical_samples"]):
    all_outputs.append("data/raw_reads_symlinks/historical/stats/multiqc/multiqc_report.html")
    all_outputs.append("results/historical/trimmed_merged_reads/stats/multiqc/multiqc_report.html")

if os.path.exists(config["modern_samples"]):
    all_outputs.append("data/raw_reads_symlinks/modern/stats/multiqc/multiqc_report.html")
    all_outputs.append("results/modern/trimmed_reads/stats/multiqc/multiqc_report.html")
```

--

* By using the `if` statement to check for the presence of historical or modern metadata files, the workflow can also be run 
  only for historical or only for modern samples
