# Reproducibility is rarer than you think

The results of only 26% out of 204 randomly selected papers in the journal
*Science* could be reproduced.<sup>1</sup>

# Combining Tools for Reproducible Research with Snakemake

.center[<img src="reproducibility-overview.png" width=40%/>]

--

* Track your Snakemake code with .green[Git] and push it to a remote .green[repository] on GitHub or BitBucket to ensure that the different code versions are tracked and available

--

* Combine Snakemake with .green[Conda] and/or .green[containers] to make the compute environment and the code reproducible

--

* Integrate foreign workflow management systems such as .green[Nextflow] pipelines into your Snakemake workflow

---

# Git

* TBA

---

# Conda

--

* Is a package, dependency, and environment manager
    > packages: any type of program (_e.g._ bowtie2, snakemake etc.)

    > dependency: other software required by a package

    > environment: a distinct collection of packages

* Keeps track of the dependencies between packages in each environment

---

# Conda

## Running a Snakemake rule with a Conda environment

--

* Make sure you have Conda installed (Miniconda or Anaconda)

--

* Find your Conda package on http://anaconda.org

--

* Create a Conda environment file (`tePSI.yaml`)

```{python conda env one, eval = FALSE}
name: tePSI
channels:
  - nanjiang
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - transposonpsi=1.0.0
```

--

* A good location for the `yaml` file can be a directory for environments within your main Snakemake directory

--

* For reproducibility, it is important to keep track of software versions >> include package versions in your environment file


---

# Conda

## Running a Snakemake rule with a Conda environment

* Add the path to the Conda environment `yaml` file to your rule with the `conda` directive

```{python conda rule, eval = FALSE}
rule transposonPSI:
    """Identify transposons in the UniProt/Swissprot protein dataset"""
    input:
        chunk = PROT_DIR + "split_result/" + PROT_NAME + "_chunk{nr}.fa"
    output:
        allHits = temp(PROT_DIR + "split_result/" + PROT_NAME + "_chunk{nr}.fa.TPSI.allHits"),
        topHits = temp(PROT_DIR + "split_result/" + PROT_NAME + "_chunk{nr}.fa.TPSI.topHits")
    params:
        dir = PROT_DIR + "split_result/"
    conda: "envs/tePSI.yaml"
    shell:
        """
        cd {params.dir}
        transposonPSI.pl {input.chunk} prot
        """
```

--

* Start your workflow on the command line with `--use-conda`

```{bash snakemake use conda, eval=FALSE}
$ snakemake --use-conda
```

--

* This doesn't work if you use `run` instead of `shell` (or other directives)

---

# Conda

## Using a Conda environment for the entire workflow

--

* Write a Conda environment file that includes all tools used by the workflow, or those used by rules with `run` directives (e.g. `gew.yaml`)

```{python conda env big, eval=FALSE}
name: gew
channels:
  - bioconda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.7.6
  - snakemake=5.22.1
  - biopython=1.76
  - matplotlib=3.2.1
  - pandas=1.0.3
  - numpy=1.18.4
```

---

# Conda

## Using a Conda environment for the entire workflow

* Create the environment

--

```{bash conda create, eval=FALSE}
$ conda env create -f gew.yml
```

--

* Use a terminal multiplexer to run the workflow in a shell instance in the background, _e.g._ tmux or screen

--

* Activate your Conda environment in the tmux or screen session

```{bash conda activate, eval=FALSE}
$ conda activate gew
```

--

* Start your Snakemake workflow

```{bash snakemake conda env, eval=FALSE}
(gew) [...] $ snakemake
```

# Docker & Singularity

--

## What can I use Docker for?

* Run applications securely isolated in a container, packaged with all dependencies and libraries

--

* As advanced environment manager

--

* To package your code with the environment it needs

--

* To package a whole workflow (*e.g.* to accompany a manuscript)

--

* And much more

--

## Singularity 

* Is an open source container platform suitable for HPC clusters

---

# Docker & Singularity

## Docker nomenclature

--

* A Docker .green[file] is a recipe used to build a Docker .green[image]

--

* A Docker .green[image] is a standalone executable package of software

--

* A Docker .green[container] is a standard unit of software run on the Docker Engine

--

* .green[DockerHub] is an online service for sharing docker images

--

* Docker images can be converted into Singularity images

---

# Docker & Singularity

## Running Snakemake rules with Singularity

--

* Snakemake can run a rule isolated in a container, using Singularity

--

* Each Conda package is also available as Docker and Singularity images (_e.g._ check http://biocontainers.pro for Conda packages from the bioconda channel)

--

* Many other Docker images are also available on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/)
    * But be aware that Docker images in free accounts are automatically deleted after a certain time of inactivity

---

# Docker & Singularity

## Running Snakemake rules with Singularity

--

* Make sure your system has Singularity installed

--

* Find your Docker or Singularity image, _e.g._ on http://biocontainers.pro

--

* Add the link to the container image to your rule with the `singularity` directive

```{python singularity rule, eval = FALSE}
rule transposonPSI:
    """Identify transposons in the UniProt/Swissprot protein dataset"""
    input:
        chunk = PROT_DIR + "split_result/" + PROT_NAME + "_chunk{nr}.fa"
    output:
        allHits = temp(PROT_DIR + "split_result/" + PROT_NAME + "_chunk{nr}.fa.TPSI.allHits"),
        topHits = temp(PROT_DIR + "split_result/" + PROT_NAME + "_chunk{nr}.fa.TPSI.topHits")
    params:
        dir = PROT_DIR + "split_result/"
    singularity: "docker://quay.io/biocontainers/transposonpsi:1.0.0--pl526_0"
    shell:
        """
        cd {params.dir}
        transposonPSI.pl {input.chunk} prot
        """
```

--

* Start your workflow on the command line with `--use-singularity`

```{bash snakemake use singularity, eval=FALSE}
$ snakemake --use-singularity
```

---

# Docker & Singularity

## Packaging your Snakemake workflow in a Docker container

--

* Write a Docker file (`my_workflow`), _e.g._

    * Start with the official Miniconda `base` image
    * Install the core packages of the workflow (_e.g._ Snakemake and dependencies such as pandas)
    * Include all rule-specific environments as separate Conda files (running your rules with Conda)
    * Include your workflow with `COPY <local-src> <container-destination>` into the Docker file
    * Include the required input data, _e.g._
        * Mount the path with the data inside the container
        * Mount a sample list, specifying their data paths

---

# Docker & Singularity

## Packaging your Snakemake workflow in a Docker container

* Create a Docker image from your Docker file (_e.g._ called `my_workflow`)

```{bash docker image, eval=FALSE}
$ docker build -t my_workflow .
```

--

* Run your container

```{bash docker run, eval=FALSE}
$ docker run --name my_first_workflow_instance -i -t my_workflow
```

--

* Share your container on GitHub or BitBucket
