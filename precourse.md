# Pre-course information

The Snakemake BYOC (bring-your-own-code) workshop is a follow up on the [NBIS
Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and we therefore expect the participants to be familiar with the material from
the Snakemake tutorial (link to the [latest version](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snakemake/)).

- Please take some time to go through the material before the workshop in case
  you didn't work with Snakemake in a while.

## Computational requirements

The participants are expected to work on computers with Linux or Mac installed
(if you run Windows and are interested in participating, please inform the
workshop organizers by email). If you haven't used Snakemake on this computer
yet, please make sure you have installed [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
before the workshop.

The workshop is held entirely online and we will work with the following tools:

- Please download and install ([Zoom](https://zoom.us/)) and test your
  sound and webcam before the workshop starts as we want to make sure we can see
  and hear each other during the workshop.
- We will send out a link to all accepted participants to join
  a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace for the workshop. You can choose to
  download and install the app or to run it in your browser.

## Feedback sessions

We will work in small groups during the workshop that will each have their own
teacher. During the first feedback session, you will receive feedback from your
group to make sure you have a good starting point to work on your project during
the workshop.

-  Please prepare a brief presentation of your "bring-your-own-code" project so
   that you can present the project to your group for the feedback session. Each
   participant will get in total 30 minutes for the presentation and for
   questions and feedback.

You might have to share your screen with the others during the feedback session.
If you are unsure if screen sharing will work (*e.g.* due to bandwidth
problems), please prepare some slides that you could send to your teacher who
could take over the screen sharing for you. Note that screen sharing might be
required during other sessions of the workshop, too.
