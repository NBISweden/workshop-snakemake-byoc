# Pre-workshop information

The Snakemake BYOC (bring-your-own-code) workshop is a follow-up on the [NBIS
Tools for reproducible research workshop](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and we therefore expect the participants to be familiar with the material from
the Snakemake tutorial (link to the [latest version](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snakemake/)).

- Please take some time to go through the material before the workshop in case
  you didn't work with Snakemake in a while.

## Computational requirements

The participants are expected to work on computers with Linux or Mac installed
(if you run Windows and are interested in participating, please inform the
workshop organizers by email). If you haven't used Snakemake on this computer
yet, please make sure you have installed [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
before the workshop.

The workshop is held entirely online and we will work with the following tools:

- Please download and install ([Zoom](https://zoom.us/)) and test your
  sound and webcam before the workshop starts as we want to make sure we can see
  and hear each other during the workshop.
- If you already have a Zoom installation, please update it to the latest version.
- We have sent out a link to all accepted participants to join
  a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace for the workshop. You can choose to
  download and install the app or to run it in your browser.

## Workshop structure

We will work in small groups during the workshop that will each have their own
teacher. The workshop is split into short lectures, feedback sessions and coding
sessions. During the coding sessions, you will have time to work on your workflow.
A teacher and maximum three other participants will be online with you for questions 
during these coding sessions.

During the feedback session on the first day, you will be asked to present your 
project so that you can receive feedback from your group to make sure you have 
a good starting point to work on your project during the workshop.

-  Please prepare a brief presentation of your "bring-your-own-code" project. Each
   participant will get in total 30 minutes for the presentation and for
   questions and feedback.

You might have to share your screen with the others during the feedback session.
If you are unsure if screen sharing will work (*e.g.* due to bandwidth
problems), please prepare some slides that you could send to your teacher who
could take over the screen sharing for you. Note that screen sharing might be
required during other sessions of the workshop, too.
